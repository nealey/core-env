Core Container Linux Functions
========

These are some functions I use in
CoreOS Container Linux
and
Google Cloud OS,
both of which provide an environment that won't run scripts from `/home`.

These mostly give me the minimum stuff I need
in order to get work done,
for various values of "work".


Usage
-----

Source it in your `.bashrc`.
Mine has a line that looks like this:

	. $HOME/core-env/functions
